# nibWindowSize
This is a TBC Classic lightweight (4kb) addon to adjust the size of the in-game windows (SpellBook, Character, Trade, Auction House, etc).

I often find myself running at low UI scales, unfortunately this makes the in-game windows small and hard to read. So this addon bring them back up to size  It can also work the other way, and make windows smaller.

All options can be adjusted at the top of Config.lua
After changing settings, type : /reload ui

Options
- Scale
- Menu / drop-down lists scale
- Custom frames
- Exclude frames
